# **Code of Conduct**

When joining the community, you must acknowledge and agree  with these rules. Here are also a few reminders of what RemoteIndian is about.

## Purpose

Help Indian engineering and product professionals passionate about building their careers as remote talent to share proven strategies, best practices and the paths that each of us are navigating in building our careers, so that we can each pursue a less travelled path without anxiety, reach our financial goals and live our lives to the fullest.

## RemoteIndian is a community

Members are here to chat, find help, ask for feedback, support each other, and connect with other like-minded people among other things.

We expect you to present yourself to the community when joining and contribute by helping and supporting other members when you can.

## RemoteIndian is open for anyone to join.

Everyone is welcome as long as people joining are here to learn and help each other.

## RemoteIndian is not specific to tech.

Although most of us are working in the tech industry, this group is open to everyone! The more diverse the better.

## Self-promotion

Please use[ #our-work](https://app.slack.com/client/T6M8YKEBA/C6W8XGP5G) channel to post your blog posts, tweets, side-projects, etc. Self-promotion on the main threads is only accepted when you are an involved member of the community. Don‚Äôt post about your launch or your product if you never contributed previously.

Keep it short and concise (don't share multiple links or repost the same link multiple times for example). Don‚Äôt ask for upvotes.


## Don‚Äôt spam.

Spam is not tolerated. IMO simply posting links is spam. Please at least write a line or two about why you‚Äôre sharing the link. That helps to get some context without opening the mentioned website.


## Don't ask to ask, just ask

Don't ask "_Any Java experts around?_", but rather ask "_How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?_‚Äù.

## Be nice and respectful.

Discussions and constructive critique are welcome. Insults and disrespect are not. We don‚Äôt have to all agree but we can talk nicely. Non-exhaustive list of forbidden stuff: sexism, racism, casteism, insults, spam, stalking, harassment, excessive self-promotion, politics.

Be respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas and opinions. Cut one another some slack. Not everyone comes from the same shared knowledge base or social framework.


## Look for opportunities to learn from, uplift, and affirm each other

Ask questions and share insights with an open heart.

Make space for others in your conversations. If you notice people dominating a discussion, ask for feedback from quieter members.


## Have a real picture/name

Something I really like from NomadList is that everyone has a real picture/name.


## Zero tolerance towards harassment

Even if our actions are not intentionally hurtful, what we say and do can hurt others or make them feel uncomfortable.  Here are some examples of harassing behaviors:



*   Unwelcome sexual attention.
*   Continued one-on-one communication after a request to stop.
*   Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
*   Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they‚Äôre not appropriate.
*   Deliberate ‚Äúouting‚Äù of any aspect of a person‚Äôs identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
*   Publication of non-harassing private communication.
*   Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
*   Threats of violence, or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
*   Any verbal, written, or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate, or coerce another community member.


## Ban.

Not respecting any of the above rules/guidelines can get you banned, with or without warning.


## Speak up.

If you think someone is not respecting these rules or is making you uncomfortable, send me a DM [Abhishek](https://remoteindian.slack.com/team/U6M8YKEFJ), [Koel](https://app.slack.com/client/T6M8YKEBA/DJJHCDC6P/) or [Saurabh](https://remoteindian.slack.com/team/UJ19GL97F) on slack. We will respect your confidentiality.

Reporting should not be done via social media or via public channels in the slack community.


## Closing Note.

RemoteIndian community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We strive to create a community grounded in equality, respect, and mutual support, and we do not tolerate harassment of our community members in any form.

It is our collective responsibility to ensure that each member of this community feels welcomed and respected. Harassment, discrimination, violence, and bigotry create feelings of fear, uneasiness, humiliation, and discomfort. Even if our actions are not intentionally hurtful, what we say and do can hurt others or make them feel uncomfortable.

This code of conduct applies to all RI spaces, including our zoom calls and in any communication with RI members, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces.
