The general consensus on this group has been: 1) Bank wire transfers are best if your client agrees to it. You should set up an EEFC account. ICICI generally has good conversion rates.
Transferwise is probably the other best option. But client needs to have an account as well.
The other thing people have tried and liked (me included) is Payoneer. That gives you a US / UK bank account - so your client can pay locally and money gets converted to your Indian bank account.
