<p>The general consensus on this group has been: </p>

<ol>
<li>1. Bank wire transfers are best if your client agrees to it. You should set up an EEFC account. ICICI generally has good conversion rates.</li>
<li>2. Transferwise is probably the other best option. But client needs to have an account as well.</li>
<li>3. The other thing people have tried and liked (me included) is Payoneer. That gives you a US / UK bank account - so your client can pay locally and money gets converted to your Indian bank account.</li>
