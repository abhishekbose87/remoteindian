## The Goal

* For the guides, please pick a topic, open an issue to get the go-ahead and [start writing](./guide.md). Note that some of these guides are *highly opinionated* and *curated*. Your opinion may not match the opinion of curator but then we are happy to discuss. 
* For the interviews, if you want to share your story, check out [this page](./interview.md)

## Contributing

* [Add/Edit a Guide](./guide.md)
* [Writing a Interview](./interview.md)

**No PR will be discarded without explanations!**

## Guidelines

- <p><strong>Adding everything available out there is not the goal!</strong><br /> 
- <p><strong>One item per Pull Request</strong><br />
  There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.</p>
- Write meaningful commit messages
