### When I think about the ability to work freelance/remotely, I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_

It enables me to work freely according to "my" own schedule. It also allows me to travel the world and see different places and meet different people. It is very liberating compared to working from the office all the time.

### How did you land your first remote/freelance gig?

I didn't think too much about it to be honest. A friend, who was already working remotely, asked me if I wanted to join. And that is how my remote journey started. So there was not much planning or motivation behind it. But once I started working remotely, I used it to the fullest.

### Do you have any rituals or habits which help you to work remotely?

I try to write more effectively than having calls or face to face communication. It saves a lot of time and allows me to work according to my schedule. Good writing also helps in other parts of life.

### What advice would you give to someone who is out there looking for a remote job or freelance work?

There are a lot of companies looking for remote developers and it is a great opportunity to do a lot of things alongside work. But it is also important to not burn out. Keeping social presence (_not social accounts_) helps a lot as well. So, travel, meet new people, make new friends and enjoy. Work is just a part of life, not everything.

### What is the biggest benefit of working remotely?

Freedom to schedule my day according to my needs and the ability to change it anytime.

### Do you see any cons of working remotely and how do you try to overcome them?

People can become workaholic and can burn out. So it is important to have a life outside of work. Hobbies, traveling, meeting new people helps.
