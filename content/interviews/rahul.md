### How did you land your current remote job ?

I liked Product Hunt & its team from when I was in college. I was an active user, was reporting a couple of bugs/feedback to Ryan & team. During my mid-sem, I pinged Ryan & Andreas to see if there was an intern role but unfortunately, there wasn‚Äôt any.

Then I finished my course and decided not to look for any job because I wanted to start a company(childhood dream & still is) so I was working on some side projects & was freelancing for a New York company. Months passed & one day I got a DM from Ryan stating that there is a junior role open and asked if I wanted to give it a try.

I said YES üòÑ.

### Do you have any rituals or habits which help you to work remotely?

Nothing special but I start my day by meditating & going to the gym. Around noon will start working. Some days I will follow the Pomodoro technique to work and I pretty much use Todoist to list all my tasks ‚úÖ

### What advice would you give to someone who is out there looking for a remote job or freelance work?

I might not be the right person to answer this because I wasn‚Äôt looking for a remote job and didn‚Äôt have any plan for getting one. But in general, I would say these are the main things required in a remote job:

- Good work ethic & focus.
- Good communication.
- Ability to make decisions.

### What is the biggest benefit of working remotely?

For me, the benefits are zero or less commute, work from anywhere or travel & more time with family/friends.

### Do you see any challenges of working remotely and how do you try to overcome it ?

Remote work has some challenges like loneliness, distraction and when to stop for the day. For loneliness, I would say we can go to some co-working space or coffee shop. For distraction or when to stop working have fixed work hours and give you 100% during that time then go and have some fun!

### Where can people can find you on the internet (if they have more questions)?

You can find me using @rahulmfg on both twitter and instagram üôÇ
